Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working for a fictional bike-share company called "Cyclistic" in the marketing analyst team. The company was launched in 2016 and, over the years, has grown and now has a fleet of 5824 bikes and 693 docking stations across Chicago. The bikes are geotracked and locked into docking network stations, and the users can unlock them from one station and return them to any other network station.

1. Ask Phase: Diving Deep into the Company's Goal, Identifying the Stakeholders, and Business Tasks.
Stakeholders
* Cyclistic is a company that is developing a bike-share program in Chicago.

* Lily Moreno is the marketing analytics team manager and the person who leads the campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.

* The marketing analytics department is a team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide the company's marketing strategy.

* The executive team is detail-oriented and will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

Marketing Strategy and CompanyÂ´s Goal.
From the beginning, the marketing strategy focused on reaching all kinds of customers by implementing a flexible pricing plan: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are mentioned as "casual riders", while those who purchase annual memberships are called "members".

The company's finance department considers that members are more profitable than casual riders for the business; thus, Lily Moreno thinks that marketing campaigns should target converting casual riders into members rather than making new customers.

In order to do that, Moreno and her analyst team are interested in identifying trends and patterns in the historical trip data about how casual riders and members differ.

This analysis will help executives to make data-driven decisions about marketing programs and strategies to convert casual riders into riders with annual memberships.

My Task

Lily Moreno has tasked me with answering the following question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?  You may have noticed that this is a SMART question because it is Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Relevant, and Time-bound.

I have to produce a report with the following deliverables:

* A clear statement of the business task

* A description of all data sources used

* Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data

* A summary of my analysis

* Supporting visualizations and key findings

* My top three recommendations based on the analysis.
